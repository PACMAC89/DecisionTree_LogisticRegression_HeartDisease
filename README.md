Heart Disease Prediction Based On The Machine Learning Models Logistic
Regression And Decision Tree

Research Question: Which individual risk factors do have the largest impact on the presence of heart disease in the USA, and
which ML algorithm performs the best to do predictions based on the selected individual risk factors?


In my research, I present a review of the existing literature on individual risk factors and ML algorithms.
Then, the research methodology is presented with a focus on Logistic Regression (LR) and Decision
Trees (CART algorithm or simply DT). In the next step, I provide the empirical results aiming at categorizing
the risk factors from strong to weak predictors. Furthermore, the models are compared based on the chosen metrics
and the results are discussed. Finally, I will offer a conclusion based on the empirical results.
